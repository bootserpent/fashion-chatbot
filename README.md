    # Show me something random or interesting
        # Task size M - 1 hour
        idea: use line count programmed on August 14 for random selection
    done, 2 hours

    # List of the industries/intended uses of apparel to explore
        # Task size M - 1 hour 
        idea: use chatgpt to fetch brands, or search for lists
                then, provide links or make more txt files

    # Piece or name (top, bottom, shoe, etc.)
        # Task size L - 2 hours
